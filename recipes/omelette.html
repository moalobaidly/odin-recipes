        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
            
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk for a few minutes until egg mixture is foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line in the middle of the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then slide omelette onto plate.</li>
